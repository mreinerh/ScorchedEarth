Paired Programming

The use of paired programming helped tremendously with this project. Since the Scorched Earth game was so complex, it helped to be able
to sit down with somebody and go through the code line by line to figure out what is going on behind the scenes, and to figure out how
to implement new methods and classes.

We used the technique of one person writing code while the other person watches and/or does research for any problems that would arise.
Having someone to doublecheck the code that we were writing in real time was a huge help and saved us numerous headaches and problems that
would have arisen later down the road. 

Not only did paired programming help us with error checking, but it also forced us to sit down together in person to work on this project. 
Meeting in person is much more effective than working remotely, and we were able to table any problems or decisions we needed to make and 
quickly has them out in order to save time and continue working diligently.
