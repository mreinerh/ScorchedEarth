Tic-Tac-Toe:
	
	This game is made up of two players: Player X and Player O. The players take turns selecting
	a tile on the game board to mark their letter in the respective tile. The player who succeeds 
	in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If
	there are not three respective marks in a row when all the tiles are full, then the game is a 
	draw and neither player wins.

	The player who's current turn it is, the players' win counts, and the count of draws are all 
	displayed in the panel to the right of the game board.

	To reset the game board and start the current game over, press the button labeled 'Reset Board'.
	This will not reset the win/draw counts. To reset the win/draw counts, press the button labeled
	'Reset Scores'. To return to the main menu, press the button labeled 'Main Menu'. This will end
	the current game and reset the board, but the scores will remain should you decide to return to 
	play tic-tac-toe.

	If you are upset with the move you made, or made an accidental move, you can press 'CTRL + Z' to
	undo the last move. If you continue to press this key combination, each previous move will be 
	undone one at a time until the entire board is reset. 

Scorched Earth:

	The objective of Scorched Earth is to shoot a projectile at the other player's tank and reduce all
	of the player's health. The player who reduces the other player's health to zero wins. To play, each
	player will input both the power and the angle of the shot using the slider bars at the bottom of the
	screen and press the submit button to add it to a queue. The players will go back and forth adding shots
	until both players have added five shots. One round of Scorched Earth consists of these five shots, and
	they will be fired by pressing the 'Fire' button at the bottom of the screen after all five shots have 
	been chosen by each player. The round will then play out. If there is not a winner, then another round 
	will commence. If there is a winner, a message will be displayed to display the winner, and the players 
	will be asked if they want to play again.
