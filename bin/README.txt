Matt Haneburger - P4

In order to use the arcade we have created, you must first compile the program and then run it. After you are through running the program, you may clean the current directory.

To do so follow the directions below:
	
	1) To compile the program, type 'make compile' in the command line and press enter/return.

	2) To run the program, type 'make run' in the command line and press enter/return.
	
	3) To clean the current directory after running the program, type 'make clean' in the command line
	   and press enter/return.

If you would like to run the program by typing the proper commands directly into the command line, follow the following directions:

	1) To compile the program, type 'javac *.java' in the command line and press enter/return.

	2) To run the program, type 'java P4Arcade' in the command line and press enter/return.
	
	3) To clean the current directory after running the program, type 'rm *.class' in the command line
	   and press enter/return.
		**Make sure you type 'class' and not 'java' for this step**

	**The command to run the program takes no command line arguments**
